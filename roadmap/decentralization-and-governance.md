# Decentralization and Governance

#### Community involvement will help develop the protocol and ecosystem.&#x20;

***

The Impossible Cloud project is transitioning to a fully independent foundation, which will manage the project post-deployment. Initially, the foundation will be responsible for hiring the team, managing intellectual property, and overseeing technical development. The foundation will issue tokens and governance will transition to a decentralized model. An elected council, initially composed of core members and the early community, will make decisions based on on-chain proposals and referenda. Over time, this council will become more decentralized, ensuring that the network remains open and community-governed.&#x20;

To support network expansion and hosting expenses, a treasury will be established, funded by an initial token allocation and a small percentage of network access fees. This treasury will be directed by community proposals to further develop the protocol and ecosystem. This governance model ensures a strong commitment to decentralization and community involvement, nurturing sustainable growth through the network effects and benefits provided to participants. By moving to an autonomous governance structure, we ensure that the Impossible Cloud Network remains innovative, adaptable, and community-driven in perpetuity.

# Extension of ICNP Functionality

Expand the protocol logic to fully support the economic vision, particularly the demand-based incentives that drive geographical and hardware-type expansion. The protocol will become progressively decentralized by:&#x20;

* Removing any remaining centralized components in the ledger layers.
* Extending the functionalities of SLA Oracles and introducing more trustless proofs as technically feasible without compromising service levels.
* Increasing the trustless domain of the protocols.
* Further developing protocol components to support the added functionality.

Partners already collaborating with the project, along with potential new partner projects, will cross-operate with the ICN platform, which will support different hardware classes operationally.

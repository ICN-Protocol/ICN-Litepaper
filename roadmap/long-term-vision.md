# Long-term Vision

#### The long-term vision of the project rests in the hands of the community, however, the logical steps would include introducing programmability to the ICN platform.&#x20;

Through a virtual machine, allowing SPs to program protocol actions. This would include hardware and software provisioning on hardware nodes and potentially the provisioning and deployment of “ancillary” Cloud services, such as load balancing and scheduled (distributed) background jobs.&#x20;

Similar to how Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform and Ansible interact with cloud provider APIs, using an ICNP Virtual Machine, SPs could define the necessary infrastructure and task lists using a high-level configuration language. The openness of the platform, combined with its versatility and programmability, could attract service providers, cloud providers, and developers, unleashing true and disruptive innovation in the cloud market.

# Roadmap

The "ICN Platform" is the integrated technical architecture that combines the ICN Protocol, all the connected Hardware Nodes offering various market-requested hardware classes, the SLA Oracle Nodes (SLA-ONs) for quality assurance, a user-friendly front-end, and the software components not yet decentralized. The ICN Platform is the backbone of the Impossible Cloud Network (ICN) ecosystem, which encompasses the entire ICN world, including the protocol, participants, resources, and the team.

This section outlines the anticipated evolution of the ICN Platform. Currently, the core team is developing an open-source platform for HPs and SPs to join the ecosystem, and have smart-contract guaranteed economic transactions.

The first version of the platform will support the existing object storage solution and HPs. Subsequent steps will include supporting demand-based incentives, enhancing the SLA engine, and integrating partnering projects and software.

Eventually, ICN will automate hardware and software provisioning and deployment, and SLA enforcement will be an integral component in creating trust and reliability in the system. As the platform evolves, governance will become increasingly open and inclusive, making the platform more trustless and decentralized, in line with technological advancements.

## How we got here&#x20;

Impossible Cloud has successfully developed a fully functional and robust enterprise-grade object storage service as the foundation of the ecosystem. This service is supported by several hardware providers and caters to numerous business customers, who collectively upload up to 50 million files daily. The system is designed for scalability, capable of handling billions of file uploads daily and beyond.  &#x20;

Founded by entrepreneurs who **generated over a billion dollars in total revenue** followed by a successful **IPO**, Impossible Cloud has accomplished what many web3 projects find challenging: creating a successful enterprise-grade cloud service. This accomplishment positions Impossible Cloud as a leader in the DePIN space today, offering a highly usable and reliable enterprise-grade product. With a growing network of hardware providers meeting real-world demand, the launch of ICN will now expand the suite of decentralized services available.&#x20;

## Why Start with Storage

Starting with storage leverages data gravity and locality, foundational principles for any cloud service ecosystem. Data storage is a critical component as it is required by nearly all other services, such as AI GPU compute and data processing.&#x20;

By establishing a robust storage foundation, ICN ensures that customers can run their main services close to where their data is stored, enhancing performance and efficiency. From this solid base, the roadmap includes expanding into other services like AI GPU compute, gradually building towards a fully decentralized cloud service. This approach allows for seamless integration and composability, creating a comprehensive and scalable cloud ecosystem.&#x20;

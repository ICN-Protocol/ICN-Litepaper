# Partnering Projects Software

In this phase, the protocol will gain the capability to recognize and integrate with partnering projects. The ICNP will become aware of:&#x20;

* The list of partnering projects.
* The software each partner project utilizes and should be installed on hardware nodes.
* The specific hardware class requirements for each partner project.&#x20;

The provisioning of hardware and the installation of the relevant project software will be automated., streamlining the process, and making partnerships and cross-utilization seamless and protocol enabled. The goal is to facilitate easy integration and cooperation between the ICN platform and various partner projects, enhancing the overall ecosystem's functionality and reach.&#x20;

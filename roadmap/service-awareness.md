# Service Awareness

Until now, the SLA guarantee in ICN has been tied to hardware classes. While maintaining its role as a decentralized hardware layer, ICN will need to become more service-aware to enhance the effectiveness of SLA guarantees and enforcement. Collaboration with partner projects will introduce service-aware functionalities to the protocol, making the decentralized advantages directly usable by the service stack. During this phase, the SLA interface between ICNP and Services will be developed and integrated.

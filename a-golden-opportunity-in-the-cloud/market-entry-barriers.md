# Market Entry Barriers

#### Although innovation in the cloud market is overdue, disrupting the cloud industry cannot be achieved by a single company or startup.&#x20;

***

Incumbents like AWS, GCP, and Azure have created formidable barriers to entry with extensive investments averaging $20-$50 billion annually in their hardware, infrastructure, and data centers.

The spending power of current cloud incumbents, and their vast software ecosystems create significant moats, making it nearly impossible for new entrants to outcompete them. Consequently, successful cloud competitors typically specialize in niche markets, such as Wasabi for affordable, high-performance storage, CoreWeave for GPU-accelerated compute resources, and OVH for diverse, cost-effective cloud services with a strong presence in Europe. Regulatory intervention to break up these oligopolistic companies is also unlikely due to geopolitical factors, particularly US-China tensions.

# Technical and Future Challenges

#### Moreover, current centralized cloud architectures face several critical technical and future shortcomings:

***

### World’s Transition to Distributed Networks&#x20;

Data is growing exponentially and predominantly at the edge. This growth at the edge will change the world, as it will inevitably lead to a corresponding demand for nearby compute power as well as a huge demand for distributed networks overall. The underlying effect is often described as “data gravity”, the ability of a body of data to attract applications, services, and other data \[[9](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7027582)]. The reason is simple: Moving computation to the node where that data resides (“data locality”), instead of vice versa, is way more efficient, as it minimizes network congestion and improves computation throughput \[[10](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7488250)].&#x20;

### Scalability Issues&#x20;

Rapid growth and technological advancements in the cloud sector demand scalable and flexible solutions. Storing and computing data in distributed networks is much more scalable and current providers will struggle to offer these capabilities \[[11](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1610546)]. Bitcoin is currently, with around 630 Exahashes/s (equivalent to more than 80,000 ExaFLOPS \[[12](https://bitcoincharts.com/bitcoin/)]), a few orders of magnitude higher than the most powerful non-distributed computer system in the world, Frontier with 1.7 ExaFLOPS \[[13](https://www.top500.org/lists/top500/2024/06/)].

### Emerging Technology Demands&#x20;

AI computing \[[14](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-ai-computing/)] and real-time data enrichment require immediate localized processing, which centralized systems cannot efficiently support. Single points of failure in centralized solutions risk widespread service disruptions during outages \[[15](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8736011)]. To address this issue, decentralized networks, such as IPFS, have been proposed as off-chain storage for AI models that can be invoked through smart contracts \[[16](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9978616)].&#x20;

### Energy consumption&#x20;

In cities, like Frankfurt, data center operators reported that limited power availability poses significant planning risks \[[17](https://www.cbre.de/-/media/cbre/countrygermany/data-centre/2022-q4-cbre-europe-data-centres.pdf)]. AWS is already restricting power-hungry instances that make use of GPUs in certain locations like Dublin due to power limitations \[[18](https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/09/aws\_resource\_restrictions/)]. To avoid this issue, data center infrastructure is often geographically distributed to reduce peak power demand on the local power grid and reduce the cost of ownership \[[19](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6303941)].&#x20;

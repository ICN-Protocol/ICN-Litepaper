# Customer Challenges

#### Businesses and individuals worldwide rely heavily on cloud services from major providers but face significant challenges affecting their operations and efficiency.

***

**High costs** are a major concern, as users often face escalating cloud budgets due to complex pricing structures and high fees (up to 10x higher compared to decentralized solutions \[[1](https://www.storj.io/pricing)], \[[2](https://www.impossiblecloud.com/pricing)]). Most companies have experienced budget overages and a steady increase in cloud and infrastructure costs, which highlights the financial burden imposed by current providers \[[3](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7820283/)]. This financial strain can limit the ability of businesses to invest in other critical areas, impacting their growth and innovation \[[4](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8457783)].

**Vendor lock-in:** Current cloud services impose a strong lock-in effect, restricting users' flexibility \[[5](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6415917)] and hindering their ability to switch to alternative solutions \[[6](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6682808)]. Data egress fees and the difficulties in moving data create a lack of flexibility, which can further reduce innovation and adaptability, as businesses may find it challenging to leverage newer, potentially more efficient technologies from different providers.

**Data security, privacy, and sovereignty:** Clients worry about data security and compliance with local regulations like GDPR and the US Cloud Act \[[7](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9316301)], \[[8](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7580803?casa\_token=PDR\_Q5vL0VEAAAAA:Ldte6tN8n3sF8j8NmPz9bfTdPRgLKNZ-JCRc9fOt9BylRjDlRuU03lZBjinvU5tNyb5OII7PlNQ)]. To mitigate these risks, many end users adopt inefficient multi-cloud strategies, distributing data across multiple providers and often running their own on-premises solutions. While aimed at enhancing security and compliance, this approach often leads to increased complexity and management overhead, further complicating the cloud environment for businesses.

These issues underline the necessity for a more flexible, cost-effective, and secure cloud ecosystem to meet the diverse needs of businesses and individuals worldwide.

# General Market Dominance and Centralization Concerns

#### The current cloud service ecosystem is a walled garden, partitioned and controlled by well-resourced tech giants such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This oligopolistic environment raises significant concerns:

### Concentration of Power&#x20;

The centralization of power among a few companies limits control and ownership by users and developers. This centralization increases cyber risks and data exploitation concerns, particularly under regulations like the US Cloud Act. The principle of "if you can, you will" applies here, as centralized control enables monitoring, espionage, and censoring of communications, financial transactions, and even de-banking individuals or companies, creating significant risks.

### Economic Exploitation&#x20;

Despite the cloud sector's growth, major corporations have entered an oligopolistic cash-cow stage, dominating the market and setting prices, leading to high costs for users and perpetuating their market dominance.

### Stifled Innovation

Dominance by a few large players stifles innovation, making it difficult for smaller companies to compete or introduce new technologies. This reduces market diversity and limits the dynamic progress essential for a vibrant technological ecosystem.

# ICN Partner Projects

#### ICN partners with various projects from both the Cloud DePIN space and the traditional cloud sector. Each partnership is uniquely designed to benefit both sides. Generally speaking, all partners fulfill a function as one of the aforementioned participants or provide benefits to these participants in some way.&#x20;

The underlying principle of ICN partnerships is to strengthen the evolution of the ecosystem and provide all parties with more demand than they would otherwise have. Arguably, the most important type of partnership is with projects that add additional cloud services to the network. For end users, the ability to combine multiple cloud services is often a crucial decision factor. Impossible Cloudâ€™s object storage service is merely a foundational building block for more complex use cases. For example, many use cases require a combination of data storage and GPU-compute functionalities. Multiple SPs could be used directly by customers to achieve this functionality. Alternatively, a new, further upstream, SP might combine the Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) offerings from multiple SPs into a new integrated product and offer it to end customers and clients. In every case, all ecosystem participants (SPs, HPs, and SLA-ONs) benefit.&#x20;

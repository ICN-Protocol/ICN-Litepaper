# Supply Side: Providing Capacity to ICN

#### HPs can commit hardware capacity to the network in exchange for ICNT rewards. Once their capacity is onboarded, HPs participate in the protocolâ€™s capacity marketplace to serve the capacity needs of SPs.

***

The protocol relies on a dynamic reward mechanism that allows rewards to differ across geographic or topological network clusters. In addition, it can adjust rewards based on usage in specific network clusters. This allows the protocol to attract additional hardware capacity in regions that exhibit strong demand and to discourage the onboarding of additional resources in regions that already exhibit idle capacity.

# Examples of projects partnering with ICN

* **On the SP layer:** Cloud DePIN projects can use the ICN network for their hardware needs, and enrich the ecosystem with more services en route to a truly decentralized multi service cloud. As an example, the ICN team and [Aethir](https://docs.aethir.com/), a prominent decentralized GPU project, are already working together on a possible cross-operation design. Aethir could act as an SP within the network, benefiting from market access tooling resulting in more demand for their service, and adding GPU computing capabilities to the network. A combination of cloud storage and GPU compute can unlock new use cases and, hence, even more demand.
* **On the SLA-ON layer:** DePIN Verification projects have the potential to offer their services to the ICN Protocol, enhancing the development of an increasingly trustless environment that validates the physical characteristics of connected hardware. For instance, the ICN team collaborates with [Witness Chain](https://www.witnesschain.com/), a prominent web3 tech stack, to integrate and collectively enhance network trust and reputation.
* **On the HP layer:** OEM Hardware manufacturers could partner with ICN, offering ready-to order hardware class blueprints that would simplify and speed up hardware provisioning for HPs. The ICN team and [Supermicro](https://www.supermicro.com/en/), a provider of IT solutions and bare metal servers, have struck a partnership aiming to develop the first blueprints.&#x20;
* **On the Customer- / market access tools layer:** ISV Software companies, such as [Acronis](https://www.acronis.com/en-us/), a leading provider of cybersecurity and backup software, integrate Impossible Cloudâ€™s object storage solution into their products. This directly benefits the ecosystem by opening up new use cases, markets, and revenue opportunities. This type of integration will also make it easier for other service providers (SPs) to leverage these ISVs.&#x20;

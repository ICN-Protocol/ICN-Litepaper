# Demand Side: Requesting Capacity from ICN

#### ICNP will allow SPs to access ICN hardware capacity through a fully integrated capacity marketplace, in which SPs have to acquire access tokens and spend them to secure hardware capacity. At the heart of this marketplace is a dual auction procedure, combining a tendering process and a reverse auction.&#x20;

***

In this procedure, SPs are intended to post requests for capacity in a tendering process, sourcing bids, for example, for 6 months of storage capacity in a certain geographic location, and HPs could bid to fulfill requests by locking additional ICNT for the requested period beyond the HP’s initial ICNT deposit requirement (reverse auction). As any HP’s deposited ICNT position is subject to slashing, a higher bid indicates that an HP is willing to put more at stake beyond what is required through the initial ICNT deposit requirement, signaling high hardware availability and reliability. This conscious design intends to give priority to higher-quality HPs rather than only filtering by rewards. ICNP’s capacity marketplace therefore favors highly reliable HPs, ensuring overall network quality and availability, leading to higher trust and reputation in the long run.&#x20;

Once an SP secures capacity through this procedure, the SP can integrate the secured capacity into its service offerings. At the end of the commitment period, the SP and the HP can either agree to prolong the existing arrangement or participate in a new tendering process. \

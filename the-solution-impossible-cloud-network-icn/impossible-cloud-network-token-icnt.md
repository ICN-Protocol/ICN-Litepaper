# Impossible Cloud Network Token (ICNT)

#### ICNP relies on a token-economic system to contribute, allocate, and access network resources and to ensure network reliability and performance levels. At the heart of this system lies a protocol-native utility token, the Impossible Cloud Network Token (ICNT).

***

ICNT’s primary function is to provide access to ICN network hardware capacity. HPs are awarded access tokens for their hardware capacity commitments to the network, while SPs acquire access tokens and use this currency to access hardware capacity. SLA Oracle Nodes are rewarded for monitoring, verifying, and reporting tasks.&#x20;

ICNT interacts with ICNP’s incentivization layer, which encompasses various smart contracts for provisioning hardware capacity, including contracts focused on reward structures, auction based mechanisms for allocating capacity, and a slashing system to ensure network reliability and performance. The incentivization layer will be deployed to a smart-contract-enabled blockchain environment, allowing interactions and integrations with other DePIN projects and leveraging existing tooling and protocols.&#x20;

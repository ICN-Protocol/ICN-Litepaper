# ICN network growth cycles

#### ICNP is at the heart of the ICN decentralized cloud ecosystem. ICN is built in layers composed of different participants, all connected by the ICNP and co-incentivized with a common set of rules.

These rules and the resulting marketplace are conceived to balance hardware offered in the network and cloud services consumed by design. Unlike many other DePIN projects which rely on an initial surge in token supply distributions to kickstart network capacity (e.g. to build out cellular network coverage), ICN does not require extensive overcapacity and can follow demand more closely. Consequently, ICN becomes commercially viable at a lower threshold, allowing for a more utilization-based token distribution schedule closely tracking network capacity demand.&#x20;

To further explain this point, let's consider ICN's token economy dynamics in relation to various network growth cycles. When the network has a lot more capacity than SPs need in a certain geography and for a certain hardware class, there is low utilization. Beyond a certain threshold, HPs are only weakly incentivized to add more of this particular hardware and geography combination, protecting the network from building up and overspending on idle capacity. The reverse is true for a hardware class and geography combination experiencing high demand from SPs. In this case, the network's hardware capacity expands as the amount of ICNT inflow from access fees increases, translating into higher rewards. This prompts HPs to add more capacity, reducing utilization and initiating a new growth cycle for the protocol.

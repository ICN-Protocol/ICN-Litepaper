# ICN Participants

#### The Impossible Cloud Network (ICN) takes a layered approach, consisting of a hardware layer, a service layer, and a monitoring layer:&#x20;

***

1. **Hardware Layer:** This layer ensures unprecedented **scalability**, with the potential to surpass the combined infrastructure of Amazon, Google, and Microsoft developed over the last 15-20 years. By leveraging decentralized hardware contributions, ICNP can scale its infrastructure efficiently and sustainably. &#x20;
2. **Service Layer:** The service layer enables **composability**, allowing open-source software to combine into larger constructions, similar to Lego bricks. This fosters a global knowledge store that grows at a compounding rate, enhancing innovation and service diversity.&#x20;
3. **Monitoring Layer:** The monitoring layer, consisting of SLA Oracle nodes, serves as the **layer of trust**. By implementing a best-in-class set of verifiable proofs, as they become available, ICNP will effectively address the DePIN verification problem. SLA Oracles ensure that hardware performance and compliance are continuously monitored and verified, maintaining the network's integrity and reliability.&#x20;

Correspondingly, ICN comprises three main participants: Hardware Providers (HPs), Service Providers (SPs) and SLA Oracle Nodes (SLA-ONs). Each participant plays a critical role in ensuring the network's scalability, composability, trust, and overall success. The interaction among these participants creates a powerful flywheel effect, driving continuous growth and innovation:

1.  **Hardware Providers** (HPs) add hardware capacity to the network. Each HP can&#x20;

    operate one or more Hardware Nodes (HNs) across different hardware classes, such as Storage, GPUs, and CPUs, at multiple locations. For example, an HP could operate three HNs in two locations with a combination of hardware classes at each site. Contributions from each HN are calculated separately based on resource provision and utilization over specific periods. This decentralized hardware contribution ensures unprecedented **scalability**, leveraging the community's power to surpass traditional cloud infrastructure investments by orders of magnitude.&#x20;
2.  Service Providers (SPs) use ICN's hardware capacity across different hardware&#x20;

    classes to build services, offerings, and products for business customers. In some cases, partnering Cloud DePIN projects could directly act as SPs. The composability aspect is crucial here, as SPs can seamlessly integrate multiple hardware resources and software functionalities to create complex, value-added services. This approach allows SPs to combine Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and service offerings with their proprietary software, Independent Software Vendor (ISV) integrations, and additional services like support and consulting. By leveraging the composability of the ICN ecosystem, SPs can innovate rapidly and provide highly customized solutions, while not having to build the stack from the bottom up.&#x20;
3. **SLA Oracle Nodes** (SLA-ONs) monitor, verify, and report network performance and reliability metrics. They establish a critical layer of trust by using verifiable proofs. SLA ONs enforce Service Level Agreements (SLAs) through automated penalties and rewards, ensuring high reliability and performance. This monitoring layer creates a feedback loop that continuously improves network integrity and user trust.&#x20;

ICN disentangles an otherwise fully integrated network operations ‘stack’ into separate roles (‘hardware’, ‘service’, and ‘monitoring’), each focusing on different parts of the network stack, while contributing to the common ecosystem. The system enables SPs that have already found product-market fit to focus on their strengths, specializing in specific services and market development, while expanding hardware resources as needed. It allows HPs to compete in a fair, non-monopolized market by specializing in operating and managing reliable hardware that can be offered as a resource to SPs with existing business customers. And it allows SLA-ONs to take on the role of an external, unbiased network ‘auditor’, ensuring high network performance, contributing to and benefitting from a thriving ecosystem.&#x20;

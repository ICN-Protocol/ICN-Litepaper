# The Solution: Impossible Cloud Network (ICN)

#### Based on these challenges, this Litepaper introduces Impossible Cloud Network (ICN), a decentralized ecosystem designed to capture a significant share of the global cloud market by addressing a wide range of customer needs.&#x20;

***

ICN operates in **layers** managed by different **participants**, all connected by the **ICN Protocol (ICNP)** and **incentivized in a blockchain-based marketplace**. This marketplace aims to balance hardware supply and cloud service demand, minimizing subsidies and helping service providers find their product-market fit.&#x20;

The ICNP is a decentralized, trustless protocol designed to revolutionize the cloud services market by integrating various stakeholders into a cohesive ecosystem. Leveraging blockchain technology and the power of the community, ICNP aligns incentives among hardware providers, service providers, and SLA oracle nodes, creating a secure and efficient cloud service infrastructure. This approach not only addresses the challenges of traditional centralized cloud systems but also introduces a scalable and resilient model essential for future technological demands.

# Get Involved

You can follow our progress on X **<@ICN\_Protocol>**.

We are open to partnerships at all layers of our ecosystem to fuel its growth. If you're interested in contributing hardware resources, using the network for various cloud services, or collaborating with us, please send us a message on X or via email **\<web3@impossiblecloud.com>**.

Whether you're a hardware provider, service provider, or simply enthusiastic about decentralized cloud technology, we'd love to chat and explore how you can be part of the Impossible Cloud Network's journey towards decentralized cloud services.&#x20;
